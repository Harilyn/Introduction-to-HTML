<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Harilyn, an aspiring web developer with a unique blend of introverted introspection and extroverted enthusiasm. In other words, I am an ambivert!</p>

<p>I'm into web development and love creating websites that look great and work smoothly. 
  <br>The burning desire that I have now to become a programmer was influenced by a dear friend of mine. It all started with a casual discussion which led me to discovering my own passion for the subject. As my curiosity grew, my friend encouraged me to explore further - recommending books, online resources, and tutorials that I could use to deepen my understanding of IT. I have since become fascinated by the intricacies of the digital world, and my journey into web development is a testament to my passion for creating meaningful experiences on the internet.
  </p>
  <p>I'm still learning, but I'm super motivated to keep improving and build up my skills. Right now, I'm focusing on learning languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—basically, all the stuff that help bring websites to life.
  <br>
  I’ve started working on personal projects to build my portfolio and show what I can do. It’s also a fun way to get creative and try out new ideas. I’m looking forward to collaborating with other developers and designers too—teamwork always brings in fresh perspectives.
</p>

<p>As I grow in this field, I want to dive into frameworks like React and Django to speed up my workflow and write cleaner, more efficient code. I'm also really interested in web security and learning how to make websites safe and reliable for users.
  <br>
  In the long run, my goal is to become a skilled developer who can build awesome websites that are both visually impressive and easy to use. I plan to stay updated with the latest trends, connect with other devs in online communities, and keep learning from experts at workshops and conferences.</p>
  <p>From designing eye-catching interfaces to crafting robust back-end solutions, I'm on a mission to master the art of web development. I’m excited to see how far I can go and hopefully inspire others along the way too.
